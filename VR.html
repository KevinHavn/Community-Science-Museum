          <h1>Virtual Reality exhibition</h1>
          <p>
            Our Virtual Reality exhibitions are currently under construction!
            <br />
            These are some of the exhibtions we have planned.

          <p>
            Having acquired one of the first commercially available Virtual
            Reality Headsets - the Virtuality Headset - we've decided to
            showcase it in our museum!

          <p>
            Utilizing brand new Virtual Reality technology, we're using VR
            headsets to allow our guests to view important events and art as if
            they were there!!

            alt="Picture of a man with a Virtual Reality headset on holding a paintbrush" />
          <p>
            Virtual Reality is becoming quite a significant technology - and one
            of the ways we've decided to implement it is by allowing visitors to
            paint art in Virtual Reality!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" id="exhibition3">

            src="Images/Dinosaur VR.jpg"
            alt="Two children watching a hologram of a Dinosaur off a table" />
          <p>
            In addition to taking use of Virtual Reality, we're also integrating
            Augmented Reality technology into some of our exhibitions, such as
            this table with a holographic dinosaur!
